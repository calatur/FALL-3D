## Resources
The scripts for the game have been uploaded, which perform various tasks such as character controls, combat abilities, enemy pathfinding and tracking, as well as collision detection for weapons and characters and a health system. The combat is defined by the animations, giving rise to a dynamic real-time melee experience. The level is formed by terrain, and decorated by trees, and map boundaries are defined. The camera is able to move 360 degrees at a fixed altitude around the player, both independently from the player's rotation but also able to control the character's rotation with the rotation of the camera to provide a focused combat and movement experience.
